# dans_password_generator

The goal of this project is to make a password generator.

The password generator prompts the user for the desired length of the password between 8 and 128 characters. 

Then it prompts for the perameters of the password: Upper Case, Lower Case, and Special Characters.

The user then pushes the generate passwor button, and a randomized password appears in the window.


This project required extensive use of for loops and process coordination to achieve truly randomized content.
